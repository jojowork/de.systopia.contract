# Contracts

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/systopia/de.systopia.contract.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/systopia/de.systopia.contract)

## Downloading contract files

The membership_contract custom field in membership_general custom group can hold
a contract reference. This contract reference is matched to a file located in:
`sites/default/files/civicrm/custom/contracts/{reference}.tif`

If the file does not exist, it will not be available for download and the
contract reference will not be shown as a link.

## Configuration

You must create a directory or symlink in CiviCRM customFilesUploadDir
"contracts". eg. `sites/default/files/civicrm/custom/contracts` for Drupal
environments.


## Customisation

To allow customisation to your organisation, the contract extension currently offers
the following Symfony events:
